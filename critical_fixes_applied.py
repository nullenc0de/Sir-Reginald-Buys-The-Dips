CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED TO TRADING SYSTEM
========================================

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. API SESSION RECOVERY (api_gateway.py):
   - Added session health checking in _make_request()
   - Auto-recovery when session becomes None
   - Prevents "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'request'" errors

2. DATETIME PARSING FIX (api_gateway.py):
   - Fixed created_at parsing from string to datetime object
   - Prevents "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'str'" errors
   - Added dateutil.parser for robust datetime parsing

3. AGGRESSIVE STALE ORDER CLEANUP (main.py):
   - Reduced stale order threshold from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
   - More frequent cleanup (every 3rd iteration vs 5th)
   - Added datetime type checking for created_at fields

4. INCREASED POSITION LIMITS (config.py):
   - Increased max_active_positions from 30 to 50
   - Increased max_watchlist_size from 30 to 50
   - More frequent opportunity scanning (20 min vs 30 min)

5. PROFIT-TAKING ENHANCEMENTS (main.py):
   - Added blocking order clearing logic
   - Force profit-taking on aging positions (14+ days)
   - More aggressive profit thresholds (8%, 15%, 25% vs 15%, 25%, 35%)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Order error rate should drop from 1590:22 ratio to <10:1
- Profit-taking should activate (currently 100% blocked)
- System should handle 50 positions vs current 30 limit
- Better capital utilization and turnover

NEXT STEPS:
1. Restart trading system to apply fixes
2. Monitor error rates and profit-taking activity
3. Verify session stability and datetime parsing
4. Confirm position limit increases are working
